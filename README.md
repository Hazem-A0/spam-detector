# spam-detector (Text Classification Project)
This project involves the preprocessing and classification of text data. It uses a CSV file containing messages labeled as "ham" or "spam" to train and evaluate a text classification model. The code is based on a repository licensed under the MIT License.

# Overview

The goal of this project is to build a text classification model that can differentiate between "ham" and "spam" messages. The project includes the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Text data is cleaned and transformed into numerical features using CountVectorizer.

Model Training: A classification model is trained on the preprocessed data.

Evaluation: The model is evaluated on a separate test set to assess its performance.
